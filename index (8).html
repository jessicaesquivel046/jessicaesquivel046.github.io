        <div class="subheading mb-5">Barista and College StudentðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi there! My name is Jessica Esquivel, and Iâ€™m a 19-year-old with a lifelong passion for staying active and exploring new challenges. 
        Sports have always been a central part of my life, and over the years, Iâ€™ve had the incredible opportunity to participate in a wide variety of them. I started with cheerleading and softball, gradually expanding my interests to track and field, cross country, Muay Thai, and wrestling. My dedication to wrestling took me all the way to the national competition in college, which was an amazing and rewarding experience.<br><br>

        When Iâ€™m not training or competing, I work as a barista at the new and exciting coffee shop, Dutch Bros. I really enjoy the fast-paced environment and the opportunity to meet new people every day. Thereâ€™s something special about crafting the perfect drink and seeing a customerâ€™s face light up.

Outside of work and sports, I have a creative side that comes through in my love for baking. Making sweets is one of my favorite ways to relax and express myself. Whether itâ€™s trying out new recipes or perfecting an old family favorite, thereâ€™s nothing better than filling the kitchen with delicious aromas and sharing my creations with friends and family.

Academically, I am a Spanish major with a deep appreciation for language and culture. I am currently exploring different career paths, including becoming a veterinarian or shifting my focus to nutrition. Both fields align with my love for animals and health, and I am excited to see where my passions take me.

Speaking of animals, I have always had a deep love for them, which is why I enjoy the company of my four pets. They bring so much joy and companionship into my life, and I love spending time caring for them.
<br><br>

        


Another one of my interests is cars. I find them fascinating and have started a collection of Hot Wheels, which I proudly display by pinning them to my wall at home. It's a fun and nostalgic hobby that connects me to my love for automotive design and history. At night, usually after work, I hit up the car meets to add more Hot Wheels to my collection and check out cool builds. On weekends, before work, I enjoy going on car cruises with friends and local car clubs, taking in the sights and experiencing the thrill of the road. In addition to this, I also enjoy detailing cars, sometimes even earning extra money from it. Thereâ€™s something really satisfying about transforming a carâ€™s appearance and making it look brand new again.

Iâ€™m proud of my Hispanic heritage, with my family roots tracing back to Mexico. My culture has shaped who I am today, teaching me the value of hard work, resilience, and the importance of community.

Overall, I strive to maintain a balanced and fulfilling life, where I can pursue my passions, build meaningful connections, and continue learning and growing. This little snapshot of who I am is just a glimpse, but I hope it gives you a sense of the energy and enthusiasm I bring to everything I do!
